# heart-disease-classification
in this notebook I will explore the heart disease dataset provided by http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease.
1. first we will do some data exploration to get familer with the data.
2. prepare the data for the deep learning model
3. bulding deep learning model with keras and tensorflow
4. add regulization to permit overvfitting
5. visualize the results 
6. build a randomforrest classifer
7. visualize the results and see how it compares to the deep learning results
